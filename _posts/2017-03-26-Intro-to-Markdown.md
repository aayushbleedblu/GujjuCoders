Markdown is a lightweight mark'up' language - yeah, it is ironic. It can be converted to HTML fairly easily and provides shortcuts to carry out text formatting like italicising, making lists etc using basic keyboard characters. Its primary usage revolves around the creation of readme files on platforms like github.

Basic text formatting:

1. **Italics**:  
Contain the text within underscores.  
Example : This text is in _italics_.

2. **Bold**:  
Contain the words within two asterisks.  
Example : This text is in **bold**.

3. **Headings**:  
Initiate the text with the number of '#' with respect to <h1>,<h2>,<h3> and so on.  
Example:  
# This is a heading corresponding to <h1>.  
## This is a heading corresponding to <h2>.  

4. **Links**:  
Contain the link text within '[]' and the hyperlink within ().  
Example : Click [here](/) to go to the homepage.

5. **Images**:  
To add an image, the format is precede the hyperlink format with an '!', 
the square brackets contain the alternate text while the parentheses contain the image URL.

6. **Blockquote**:  
Precede the text with a 'greater than' sign to initiate a blockquote. They are necessary when you wish to draw special attention to a particular text in a post.  
Example : Pay attention to 
> "This".

7. **Unordered list**:  
Start each item with the asterisk symbol.  
Example : An unordered list :  
* Item 1  
* Item 2  
* Item 3  

8. **Ordered list**:  
Preface the items with the corresponding numerals.

9. **Sublists**:   
Indent items one-space inside to create a sublist of the parent.  
Example:  
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2.1
  * Item 2.2
* Item 3  

10. **New line**:  
Add two spaces at the end to start a new line.  
Example : Start a new  
line.
