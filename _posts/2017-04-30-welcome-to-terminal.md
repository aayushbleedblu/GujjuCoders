How boring is it to come back to same old terminal everytime and find `samip@samip-uos:~$` staring back at you. I don't know about you but I find it sickening.

So I ended up doing something more comfortable. I have a habit of using [momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) in chrome to greet me whenever I open chrome so that I am not reminded of HOME SWEET HOME. Similarly terminal which is always in from of my eyes need to greet me too afterall I am master and terminal my slave. :smiling_imp:  
So lets get to interesting part. I made a script thats entered in `.bashrc` so that terminal greets me everytime it is opened.
