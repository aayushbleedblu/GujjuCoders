Just admit it! Everyone loves Batman. And if you don't, are you even human bruh? Okay, done with the jokes. Time to get a little geeky about this DC superhero. If you are a man of Science, you would definitely agree that every shape in this physical world is a representation of some complex mathematical equations. So, I won't be lying if I say that if I somehow know the mathematical equation of some shape, I can recreate it.

Let us create the famous Batman logo.

MATLAB is a powerful tool to plot mathematical equations, which are otherwise tiresome to solve. The MATLAB code to plot the Batman curve is as follows:

{% gist 2ccb2fb6ea25c2c08c5d498dbc503bd6 %}

The result looks something like this.

Go ahead! Try it.
